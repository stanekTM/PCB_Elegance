# My edited version PCB Elegance
Somehow I didn't like "Kickad" and "EasyEda", I just like PCB Elegance.
I want to say in advance that with my modified version I generate gerber files reliably as the original versions and have PCBs manufactured in China.
This version of PCB Elegance is continually modified to suit my liking. I am gradually removing the errors that occur.
Unfortunately I am not writing a record of the changes I made.
This version is not installed, just unzip the itself files folder to disk. The key is the "PCB_Elegance_v3.52.0" folder,
here is also the latest version of the release.
By default, the programs are in "EN". Other translations are only in "CZ".  If you are a proud Czech,
copy the translation files from the "Translations\CZ" folder to the main "PCB_Elegance_v3.52.0" directory.
Keep in mind that there are thousands of words in software tools and some are not yet finished.
In the PCB project I deal with programming and translation errors and do it in my free time as my hobby in electronics and RC modeling.

Translations in "CZ" will by no means go with the original version from http://www.pcbelegance.org
