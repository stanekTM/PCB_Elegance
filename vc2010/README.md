# Instructions for building/compiling
Unzip the source code archive into am empty directory.

The source code can be compiled with either VC2015 (Microsoft Visual Studio 2019)

For VC2015 open the solution file "vc2010\pcbeleg.sln"

The solution contains all the projects for "PCB Elegance 3.52.0"

When doing a rebuild (Debug/release) all executables/libraries are compiled.

# For developers
Lines of code are sometimes commented in "EN" and otherwise in "CZ".
I did it solely for myself and for pleasure. I'm sorry if you want to improve this version further.
Maybe I'll get better next time /:o)
