<P>Annotation means numbering the component references who are named like (R?,C?,U?) automatically. After annotation the quotation character of the component references have been replaced by a number. The numbering of component references is done per sheet. The Top sheet will start with the number 100. For example resistors will start with R100 etc. The next (sub)sheet will start with the number 200. If the top sheet contains for example more then 100 resistor, the next (sub)sheet will start with the number 300. If possible do not place more than 100 component references of each family (resistors, capacitors) on each sheet. It is also possible that a sheet has a start number for annotation of the references. See <IMG SRC="../images/button6.gif" ALT="" BORDER=0>View sheet/symbol options</P>

<P>Component references who do not have this quotation character will not change.</P>

<P>If there has been a small modification to a sheet, for example one resistor added, annotation will proceed as follows. This new resistor with the component reference R? will be renamed. The number that will replace the quotation character will be the highest not used number on this sheet. This means that resistors (numbers) that have been deleted in an earlier stage, will not be used again.</P>

<P>In the next dialogbox four annotation methods can be selected, and the maximum of references per sheet.</P>

<P><U>Restart annotation (Standard numbering)</U></P>

<P>All the component references will be renumbered starting with one.</P>

<P><U>Restart annotation (Numbering per sheet)</U></P>

<P>All the component references will be renumbered, starting on a hundred per sheet. The resistors on the first sheet start with 100, and resistors on the seconds will start with 200, etc. If there is a need for more than 100 references for a group (resistors/capacitors), increase the number of references per sheet.</P>

<P><U>Appending annotation (Standard numbering)</U></P>

<P>In a existing design this annotation form will be used. Only the component references who are not numbered will get a new number. A new number means a number that has not be used before. Usually this will be a number greater than the highest number used.</P>

<P>In a existing design this annotation form will be used. Only the component references who are not numbered will get a new number. A new number means a number that has not be used before. Usually this will be a number greater than the highest number used. On every sheet this new number will be the last number used plus one.</P>
