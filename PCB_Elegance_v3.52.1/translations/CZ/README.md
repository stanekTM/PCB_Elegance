# My version of Czech translations
Here is the latest version of the Czech translation edition.
Copy the path of the translation folder in advance, for example "C:\PCB_Elegance_v3.52.1\translations\CZ".
Then start the main program "Design manager" by right-clicking "run as administrator" and click on "Configure paths" in the "Edit" tab.
In the "Language path set" setting, switch to the "Other language" entry and enter the path of the translation folder, for example "C:\PCB_Elegance_v3.52.1\translations\CZ".
Confirm "OK" and restart the program.
All translations should be in Czech.

Remember that there are thousands of words in software tools and some are not ready yet.

Translations in "CZ" will by no means go with the original version from http://www.pcbelegance.org
