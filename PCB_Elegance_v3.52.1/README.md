# My edited version PCB Elegance
Somehow I didn't like "Kickad" and "EasyEda", I just prefer PCB Elegance which is closer to me.
This version of "PCB Elegance" is compatible with Windows 7, 8 and 10.
I want to say in advance that with my modified version I generate gerber files reliably as the original versions and have PCBs manufactured in China.
This version of PCB Elegance is continually modified to suit my liking. 
Unfortunately I am not writing a record of the changes I made.
This version is not installed, just unzip the itself files folder to disk. The key is the "PCB_Elegance_v3.52.1" folder, here is also the latest version of the release.
By default, the programs are in "EN". Other translations are only in "CZ". If you are a proud Czech, copy the translation files from the "Translations\CZ" folder to the main "PCB_Elegance_v3.52.1" directory.
Keep in mind that there are thousands of words in software tools and some are not yet finished. 

Translations in "CZ" will by no means go with the original version from http://www.pcbelegance.org
