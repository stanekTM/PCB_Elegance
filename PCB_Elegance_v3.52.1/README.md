# My version PCB Elegance
This version is not installed, just extract the file folder to disk.
The key is the folder "PCB_Elegance_v3.52.1", here is also the latest version of the release.
By default, the programs are in "EN".
Other translations are only in "CZ".
If you are a proud Czech, copy the translation files from the "Translations\CZ" folder to the main directory "PCB_Elegance_v3.52.1".
Remember that there are thousands of words in software tools and some are not ready yet.

Translations in "CZ" will by no means go with the original version from http://www.pcbelegance.org
