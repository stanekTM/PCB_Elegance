# My version of Czech translations
Here is the latest version of the translations release.
If you are a proud Czech, copy the translation files from the "Translations\CZ" folder to the main "PCB_Elegance_v3.52.1" directory.
Keep in mind that there are thousands of words in software tools and some are not yet finished.
In the PCB project I deal with programming and translation errors and do it in my free time as my hobby in electronics and RC modeling.

Translations in "CZ" will by no means go with the original version from http://www.pcbelegance.org
